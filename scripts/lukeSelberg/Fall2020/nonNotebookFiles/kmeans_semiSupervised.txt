kmeans_semiSupervised:
    The meanshift algorithm is used to identity locations of high density within the kmer space of the data, and then the unsupervised k-means model is run with these locations as the initial centroid coordinates.  The known labels are then compared against the many predicted labels and these clusters are reassigned into groups that minimize the prediction error.
    
Parameters:
    fasta - fasta file to do analysis on
    klength_min - minimum kmer length, defaulted to 6
    klength_max - maximum kmer length, defaulted to 6
    rNum - random number, defaulted to 50
    y_hat - known labels
    
Output: 
    newLabels - list of labels 
    kmerXTableInput - kmer table
